# Tic Tac Toe Game

Tic Tac Toe is a simple game with three difficulty settings. You will randomly be assigned X or O and your goal is to get three in a row.

## Easy Difficulty

On easy difficulty mode the computer plays randomly.

## Medium Difficulty

On medium difficulty mode the computer checks if it has a way to win. If not, it plays randomly.

## Hard Difficulty

On hard difficulty mode the computer checks if it has a way to win, then checks if its opponent has a way to win next turn in order to block them, and if neither of those conditions are true it plays randomly.
